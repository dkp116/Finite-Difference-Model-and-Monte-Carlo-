# Asian Option Pricing Simulator Using Monte Carlo and American Vanilla Option Pricing Using Finite Difference

This project implements an option pricing simulator using various financial models, including the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations. It supports pricing Asian options and European options, with methods to compute prices using direct Monte Carlo simulations, variance reduction techniques, and the Black-Scholes analytical formulas.
